### Hi there ğŸ‘‹<!--

**grivera333/grivera333** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


My name is Gabriel Rivera and my email address is grrivera@my.waketech.edu my github account is pretty empty right now but im hoping to work more on it later.
This repository is here is place a where I can keep all my code the only file in it right now is my README.md
I made sure to make an account and add a README.md file to my orginal repository then downloaded github desktop and cloned that same repository to desktop file explorer. This is so i can work on it now and update or "push" it later.
